<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The Chrome Developer Tools (DevTools for short), are a set of web authoring and debugging tools built into Google Chrome. </p>
<p>The DevTools provide web developers deep access into the internals of the browser and their web application.</p>
<p>In a nutshell,there are eight main groups of tools available view Developer Tools, and the capabilities are being extended with every release. Chrome now offers Elements, Resources, Scripts, Timeline, Profiles, Storage, Audits, and Console. </p>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<p> The Resources Tab in Developer Tools is your window into the communication between web server and client browser. You are able to see all of the resources requested by the browser (this is always very surprising!), the time it takes to receive them from the server, and how much bandwidth is used during the transfer.</p>
<p>
Ironically, running the Resources Tab affects page load performance, so it is disabled by default. The first time you access the functionality, you will need to enable it for the page you are viewing. </p>
<h2>Elements</h2>
<p>The Elements tool allows you to see the web page as the browser sees it. That is, using the Elements tool, you can see the raw HTML, raw CSS styles, the Document Object Model, and manipulate either in real time.</p>
<h2>Scripts</h2>
<p>To peer inside the JavaScript for a page, you will use the Scripts tool. Here you can find a list of scripts required by the page plus a full featured script debugger. You can even change the JavaScript on the fly!</p>
<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>For advanced timing and speed analysis, the Timeline tool offers in-depth visibility into the various Chrome behind-the-scenes activities. You can learn how long the browser takes to handle DOM events, rendering page layouts, and paint the window.</p>
<h2>Profiles</h2>
<p>The Profiles tool helps you capture and analyze the performance of JavaScript scripts. For example, you can learn which functions take the most time to execute and zero in on exactly where to optimize.</p>
<h2>Storage</h2>
<p>Modern web applications require more persistence than simply cookies, and the Storage tool helps you track, query, and debug local browser storage. This tool can display and query data stored in local databases, local storage, session storage, and cookies.</p>
<h2>Audits</h2>
<p>The Audit tool is like having your own web optimization consultant sitting next to you. This tool can analyze a page as it loads and provide suggestions and optimizations for decreasing page load time and increase perceived (and real) responsiveness. </p>
<h2>Console</h2>
<p>Last but definitely not least, the Developer Tools offers a full featured Console. From the Console, you can enter arbitrary JavaScript and programmatically interact with your page.</p>
<h1>Starting Up</h1>
<p> It's easy to start the Developer Tools while inside Chrome.</p>
<p>
For any operating system, you can simply right-click on any element in the page and select the "Inspect Element" option from the context menu. This will open the Developer Tools and drill right to the element you clicked on. </p>
