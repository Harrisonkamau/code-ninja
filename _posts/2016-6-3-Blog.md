<h2>Object Oriented Programming(OOP)</h2>
<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a software programming model constructed around objects. This model compartmentalizes data into objects (data fields) and describes object contents and behavior through the declaration of classes (methods).</p>

<p><h2>Features of Object Oriented Programming</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Inheritance</strong>: This refers to the hierarchical arrangement of implementation fragments. Through inheritance,less code is written, and multiple objects could 'inherit' the features of a class. E.g. A car class can have common features such as number of tyres, engine and door which are visible in different types of cars. A class could be seen as a template that describes the details of an object. </li>
			<li><strong>Polymorphism</strong>: This means abstract entities are implemented in multiple ways.</li>
			<li><strong>Encapsulation</strong>: This makes the program structure easier to manage because each objectâ€™s implementation and state are hidden behind well-defined boundaries. </li>
		</ul>
	</p>
<p>Object-oriented programming allows for simplified programming. Its benefits include reusability, refactoring, extensibility, maintenance and efficiency.</p>
