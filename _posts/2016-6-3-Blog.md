<h2>Object Oriented Programming(OOP)</h2>
<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a software programming model constructed around objects. This model compartmentalizes data into objects (data fields) and describes object contents and behavior through the declaration of classes (methods).</p>

<p><h2>Features of Object Oriented Programming</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Inheritance</strong>: This refers to the hierarchical arrangement of implementation fragments. Through inheritance,less code is written, and multiple objects could 'inherit' the features of a class. E.g. A car class can have common features such as number of tyres, engine and door which are visible in different types of cars. A class could be seen as a template that describes the details of an object. </li>
			<li><strong>Polymorphism</strong>: This means abstract entities are implemented in multiple ways.</li>
			<li><strong>Encapsulation</strong>: This makes the program structure easier to manage because each object’s implementation and state are hidden behind well-defined boundaries. </li>
		</ul>
	</p>
<p>Object-oriented programming allows for simplified programming. Its benefits include reusability, refactoring, extensibility, maintenance and efficiency.</p>

<h1>Principles of OOP</h1>
<p>In order for a programming language to be object-oriented, it has to enable working with classes and objects as well as the implementation and use of the fundamental object-oriented principles and concepts: inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation and polymorphism.</p>
<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p>Inheritance is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming. It allows a class to "inherit" (behavior or characteristics) of another, more general class. </p>
<p>For example, a lion belongs to the biological family of cats (Felidae). All cats that have four paws, are predators and hunt their prey. This functionality can be coded once in the <strong>Felidae</strong> class and all its predators can reuse it – <strong>Tiger, Puma, Bobcat</strong>, etc. Inheritance is described as <strong>is-kind-of relationship</strong>, e.g. <strong>Tiger</strong> is kind of Animal.</p>
<p>The class from which we inherit is referred to as parent class or base class / super class.</p>
<p>This is how the inheriting class, Lion, looks like:</p>
~~~.NET
	~~~
	Lion.cs
	~~~
public class Lion : Felidae
{
	private int weight;
	// Keyword "base" will be explained in the next paragraph

	public Lion(bool male, int weight) : base(male)
	{
			this.weight = weight;
	}
	public int Weight
	{
			get { return weight; }
			set { this.weight = value; }
	}
}
~~~
<h2>Abstraction</h2>
<p>The next core principle of object-oriented programming we are about to examine is "abstraction". Abstraction means working with something we know how to use without knowing how it works internally. A good example is a television set. We don’t need to know the inner workings of a TV, in order to use it. All we need is a remote control with a small set of buttons (the interface of the remote) and we will be able to watch TV.</p>
<p>Abstraction is one of the most important concepts in programming and OOP. It allows us to write code, which works with abstract data structures (like dictionaries, lists, arrays and others). We can work with an abstract data type by using its interface without concerning ourselves with its implementation. For instance, we can save to a file all elements from a list without bothering if it is implemented with an array, a linked list, etc. The code remains unchanged, when we work with other data types. We can even write new data types (we will discuss this later) and make them work with our program without changing it.</p>
