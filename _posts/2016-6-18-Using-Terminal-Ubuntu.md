<h1>Using Linux Terminal</h1>
<p>Whether you’re a new Linux user or you’ve been using Linux for a while, we’ll help you get started with the terminal. The terminal isn’t something you should be scared of – it’s a powerful tool with lots of uses.</p>

<h2>Basic Terminal Usage</h2>
<p>Launch a terminal from your desktop’s application menu and you will see the bash shell. There are other shells, but most Linux distributions use bash by default.</p>

<h2>Installing Software</h2>
<p>One of the most efficient things to do from the terminal is install software. Software management applications like the Ubuntu Software Center are fancy frontends to the few terminal commands they use in the background. Instead of clicking around and selecting applications one-by-one, you can install them with a terminal command. You even even install multiple applications with a single command.</p>
<p>On Ubuntu (other distributions have their own package management systems), the command to install a new software package is:</p>

sudo apt-get install packagename
