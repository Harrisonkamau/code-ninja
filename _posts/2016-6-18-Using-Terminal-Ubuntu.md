<h1>Using Linux Terminal</h1>
<p>Whether you’re a new Linux user or you’ve been using Linux for a while, we’ll help you get started with the terminal. The terminal isn’t something you should be scared of – it’s a powerful tool with lots of uses.</p>

<h2>Basic Terminal Usage</h2>
<p>Launch a terminal from your desktop’s application menu and you will see the bash shell. There are other shells, but most Linux distributions use bash by default.</p>
